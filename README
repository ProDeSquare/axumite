Axumite
=======

Axumite is a lightweight and optimized API framework built on top of Axum.
It is designed to provide a structured, ready-to-serve foundation for building high-performance, rate-limited, database-backed web APIs in Rust.

Originally crafted for my own work, Axumite embodies my preferred architecture for service design-simple, predictable, and efficient. It integrates PostgreSQL, Redis, rate limiting, and tracing, while retaining the asynchronous precision and composability that make Axum exceptional.

Though this framework was built for my personal use, anyone is free to use, modify, or extend it for both personal and commercial projects.
